	    <h2>Header two one</h2>
		<p>
		    We believe that most of the web does not need to be dynamic
		    and increasing complexity on server-side applications is one
		    of the main reasons for the web obesity crisis. The common approach
		    nowadays is to do everything on the server, including parsing
		    requests, modifying files and databases, generating HTML and
		    all that using unfit languages like PHP or JavaScript, which
		    is a security and efficiency nightmare.

        <h2>Header two two</h2>
        <p>
            Over the years we have seen massive amounts of security holes
            in numerous applications of tools commonly used for these
            jobs (PHP, node.js, CGI-implementations, ...).

            <h3>Header three two two one</h3>
            The reason why
            we are in this situation in the first place is due to the fact
            that the jobs of data processing and data presentation, which
            should be separate, converged together into one.

            The solution is to rely on static regeneration independent
            from the web server, which just serves static files. You can
            still implement e.g. form handlers for dynamic content which
            run as their own network instance and operate independently
            from the web server. What's left is just to generate the static
            content using the database and repeating this process in case
            the database is updated.
